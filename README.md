In this project I have firstly installed the npm required files and then created a port 3000 and then using express ejs I have taken the sim card details from the user and stored it in the MongoDB using the URL.
After that if the user add the sim card details it gets activated and to deactivate it finds the user from database and change the status to deactivate.
